# UCI Heart Disease Analysis

This project involves an in-depth analysis of the UCI Heart Disease dataset. The goal is to uncover critical factors contributing to heart disease using various data visualization techniques and modeling methods.

## Project Structure
- `HeartDisease.py`: Python script for data analysis.
- `heart.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.
- `Final Analysis.pdf`: Final report for the project.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model comparison using Python, SAS Miner, and Orange
- Logistic regression model implementation

## Findings
- Key predictive variables for heart disease
- Model performance comparison

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`.
3. Run the Python script `HeartDisease.py`.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights for medical research and preventive strategies regarding heart disease.
